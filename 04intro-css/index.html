        <h2>What is the Evillious Chronicles?</h2>
        <p>
            The Evillious Chronicles is a Japanese multimedia series of interconnected Vocaloid songs, manga, light
            novels, and more created by Japanese musician Akuno-P (also known as MOTHY). The series is known for its
            complex narrative, rich world-building, and dark themes. It explores the rise and fall of various characters
            and civilizations within the fictional world of Evillious, often delving into themes of sin, redemption, and
            the cyclical nature of history.
        </p>
        <h2>Who is MOTHY?</h2>
        <p>
            MOTHY, also known as Akuno-P, is the creator of the Evillious Chronicles. He is a Japanese musician and
            producer who gained fame for his Vocaloid songs. MOTHY is known for his intricate storytelling and
            world-building, which are central to the Evillious Chronicles. His work has garnered a dedicated fanbase
            both in Japan and internationally.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Vocaloid?</h2>
        <p>
            Vocaloid is a singing voice synthesizer technology developed by Yamaha. It allows users to create vocal
            tracks by inputting lyrics and melodies, which are then sung by virtual singers. The Vocaloid software uses
            voice banks recorded from real singers to produce realistic singing voices. The technology has been widely
            used in the creation of music, particularly in the Japanese pop and electronic music scenes. Many Vocaloid
            characters, such as Hatsune Miku, have become cultural icons and are featured in various media, including
            music videos, concerts, and merchandise.
        </p>
        <h2>Where do I start?</h2>
        <p>
            If you're new to the Evillious Chronicles, a good starting point is to explore the music. Listening to the
            main songs in the series will give you a sense of the story and themes. You can also check out the official
            manga and light novels for a more in-depth understanding of the characters and plot. Don't hesitate to dive
            into the fan community as wellâ€”there are many resources, discussions, and analyses available to help you on
            your journey! But, for this site, <strong>I recommend starting with the <a
                    href="characters.html">characters</a></strong> to get to know our cast and <em>then</em> move on to
            the <a href="timeline.html">timeline</a>. All of this, however, will be explained in more detail in the <a
