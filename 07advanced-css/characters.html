                <strong>Behemo Barisol (ビヒモ＝バリーゾール)</strong><br>
                Vocaloid portrayal: Len Kagamine (鏡音レン)
            </dt>
            <dd>
                The closest to a protagonist in the series besides maybe his older twin sister and one of the few
                characters who
                recurs frequently throughout the entire series. He was related to the wealthy developer of a virtual
                world, and created his own avatar, which would later become Levia. Since he was young, he was feminine
                and often faced challenges related to his identity. Because of the technological advancements of the
                virtual world, he was able to explore and express his identity in ways that were not possible in the
                real world. This also allowed him to later join the team that would create the Third Period, ascending
                him to basically godhood, first as one of the Twin Dragon Gods and then as the Master of the Heavenly
                Yard.

                <strong>Levia Barisol (レビア＝バリーゾール)</strong><br>
                Vocaloid portrayal: Rin Kagamine (鏡音リン)
            </dt>
            <dd>
                The other half of the Barisol siblings, often seen as the more morally ambiguous counterpart to Behemo.
                She was created as Behemo's ideal self and was smart. So smart, she attended college at just six years
                old. After the spread of the disease HERS (Hereditary Evil Raiser Syndrome), she became fascinated with
                the idea of evil and became a scientist to study the very question of why evil exists and how humans are
                capable of doing horrific things. Levia ended up contracting the disease herself and sought to find a
                cure. With the help of her colleague, Seth, she found the First Period and the truth about her own
                existence. Believing it would cure her, she attempted to kill Behemo, but soon realized that would only
                make it worse and instead offered to take Behemo to her world. She is another one of the team
                responsible for the creation of the Third Period and consequently, another deity. She is the other half
                of the pair of Twin Dragon Gods and becomes Master of the Hellish Yard. She also is a frequently
                recurring character throughout the series and like her brother, reincarnates into several other
                characters.

            </dt>
            <dd>One of the main antagonists of the series. He is an artificial species of sentient masks who never felt
                understood. Eventually, he contracted HERS and worked alongside Levia. When she came to him for help, he
                suggested that she kill her "other half", meaning Behemo. However, he did this so he could take her
                place aboard an ark with 72 other scientists sent to leave this world and find a new one to start anew.
                Levia would come back with Behemo and Seth would stow away on the ship anyway. Through the rest of the
                series, he frequently shows up and creates chaos wherever he goes. His main goal is to spread HERS and
                with it, violence and destruction. Though, he was one of the survivors of the ark's crash in the Third
                Period, which he caused, he never became a god, but would eventually become the Demon of Wrath. </dd>

            <dd>Grew up in an orphanage in the Third Period. When she was 14, she was struck by lightning and had a
                vision of the Twin Dragon Gods, who told her they were her true parents and that they would world would
                end unless they were given proper vessels to reincarnate into. Because of this, she became the queen and
                prophet of Levantia. Her name was changed to Alice Merry-Go-Round and she gave birth to twins. It was
                allegedly a virgin conception, but no one believed her. To prevent a scandal, the children were ordered
                to be killed. The orders were carried out by Seth, but not before he experimented on the twins. Her
                prophecy started Project Ma until it's first failure with Eve. Then, her people rose against her,
                calling her a false prophet. She even began to doubt her visions herself. From then on, she was a puppet
                queen controlled by others.

                Son of Maria Moonlit and husband to Eve Zvezda. He was a prominent scientist in Levantia and was in
                charge of Project Ma. After he and his sister's attempted murder, he was rescued by a forest spirit and
                then raised in an orphanage. Eventually a man, who was actually Seth in disguise, took him in and
                eventually told him the truth about his mother. He decided to get revenge on the government and those
                who tried to kill him and control and keep him from his mother. The best way to do this would be to get
                involved in Project Ma as the mother of the vessels of the twin dragon gods would become queen, which
                would make the father the king. So, he went searching for a potential candidate, which he found in Eve
                after she rescued him from a bandit attack. He then drugged Eve to make her fall in love with him and
                eventually she was selected to become the Mem Alpha. Unfortunately, the drugs in her system caused the
                stillbirth of the twins and it was only then, after he had failed, that he realized he genuinely loved
                Eve. The two of them got married in Held's forest and adopted Hansel and Gretel. He is another
                frequently recurring character throughout the series and reincarnates into several other characters.

                others by Irina. When Levia tricked Kiril into destroying Levantia, she was telling the truth. It did
                bring Elluka back, in a way. But a piece of Levia was in her, too. She lost her memory and became
                basically immortal. She also worked with the tree spirit Held Yggdra to find the seven deadly sins. She
                is one of the few characters who recurs frequently throughout the entire series.

                and all Seth needed to do was suggest that if she killed the others, then she would be queen. So, she
                did, making them all seem like tragic accidents. She then became queen for a short while before Kiril
                destroyed levantia. She was gravely injured, but then Seth came and gave her a body to posess.
                Specifically, the body of a plush cat. It was a cruel joke on his part, but Irina found a new purpose.
                After learning Elluka was alive, she became obsessed with revenge and opposed her every step of the way,
                collecting the seven deadly sins before Elluka could. She is another of the ghoul children created by
                Seth and is another frequently recurring character throughout the series.

                Brother of Sateriasis Venomania and son of Ilotte Venomania. He was a duke of Beelzenia and the vessel
                of lust.
                Unfortunately, was born with a facial deformity. Because of this, his parents kept him locked
                away in
                their mansion until his brother found him. He began sneaking out with his brother regularly and
                eventually met Gumina Glassred. The three ofthem became friends and played together and Cherubim
                fell in
                love with Gumina. By the time he confessed his love, it was too late. She was already engaged to
                Sateriasis. Overcome with jealousy, he killed his entire family and staff. At the realization of
                what he
                had done, he attempted to take his own life. But then, he was approached by a woman in a dark
                cloak
                called I.R., who offered a katana to him and told him to use it instead. This would make a
                contract with
                the Demon of Lust, and he would become its vessel. He accepted and gained certain powers. Among
                those,
                he could alter his appearance. So, he assumed the identity of Sateriasis. These powers came at a
                cost,
                however. He would be overcome with lustful desires and had to act on them or else there would be
                consequences. He formed a harem and slept with basically every woman in the kingdom. This came
                to bite
                him in the end, however, when a man by the name of Karchess Krim went looking for his wife and
                found her
                in Cherubim's harem and stabbed him in revenge. The illusions Cherubim used began to fade and
                one by one
                his lovers abandoned him, the last being Gumina who was the only one to look back as he lay
                dying and
                alone on the floor.

                A duchess of Beelzenia and vessel of gluttony. The night of her birth, at a celebratory feast, her
                family contracted a disease that gave them insatiable hunger. Since she was so young, she obviously did
                not partake and was the only one to not contract the disease. Still, it affected her when her parents
                practically forced food down her throat and they began to tease her for her weight gain because of it.
                She was betrothed to a man named Carlos Marlon, who at first did not like each other but then grew close
                from a shared desire to travel the world. Obsessed with food since an early age, Banica eventually
                made a contract with the Demon of Gluttony to taste all the foods in the world without gaining weight or
                getting sick, leading her to eat the most grotesque foods imaginable. This earned her the nickname, "The
                Evil Food Eater Conchita". The engagement between her and Carlos would be called off because of her
                behavior following this, but the two of them would reunite after Carlos disguised himself as a chef in
                Banica's palace. They would eventually have a child together while Banica's hunger only got worse.
                Carlos,
                fearing for Banica, himself, and his child, attempted to poison her and himself. However, she was immune
                and Carlos died. Eventually, Banica's hunger got to the point she had tasted literally everything and
                had a strong urge to eat her child. But, she resisted through curiosity and instead realized there was
                one food she hadn't tried. Herself. Literally consumed by her sin, she herself became the demon of
                gluttony.

                name of Josef Crim, but would eventually be found out. The lovers would fall in love again and have a
                child, but Banica's gluttony only consumed her more and Carlos needed to stop her, so he attempted to
                poison her and himself with a dose of a special medicine he uses to treat a rare genetic disease.
                However, she was immune and he would die because of it.
